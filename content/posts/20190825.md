I do not wanna go for alchhol or anything like that.

I do not believe in something whatever God or PRC.

I know exactly money smells better than love.

I am a tree in my fantasy but a sunburned one.
 
I have no hope for mercy or compassion.
 
Someone told me there's a better tomorrow.

Replied a smile.

Tomorrow I am going to die.
